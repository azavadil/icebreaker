        After making a couple of friends but not successfully finding a romantic connection through the more traditional dating methods, I've decided to give online dating a shot. <br>
<br>
I'm a normal, attractive, independent young woman looking for a relationship-minded man for a strong intellectual, emotional and physical connection. I'm not looking for a casual connection, so we need to do more than mesh well in the bedroom, but I'm also not just looking for another friend, so physical attraction and sexual compatibility are important elements as well. <br>
<br>
I have a great sense of humor, am very down-to-earth, fun, spontaneous, yet responsible. I'm employed full time, make a six figure salary, which is to say that I'm not on the lookout for your wallet, nor a man that is intimidated by successful women. I work hard to maintain a comfortable life, but when I put the work away, I'd love to have someone special to enjoy the more important moments in life. <br>
<br>
I'm 5'8", with feminine hips/curves, a large bust, and an active lifestyle. I enjoy biking, swimming, local parks and trails, and spur of the moment weekend get-a-ways. The man I'm looking for is intelligent, successful, attractive (to me), tall, employed, single, funny, and kind. He's entirely drug and disease free, as am I. Please be no younger than me, and no older than 40. <br>
<br>
Blanket replies will be ignored. Pic for pic.

        I am the perfect mix of successful sophistication and tartness, uniquely able to network with high profile executives through intellectual discourse, or to silently win over a crowd with my demure sultriness that incites insatiable intrigue. I enjoy reading and discussing current events and business, international affairs, and anything I have not read or discussed before. I like music, outdoor music festivals, electronic music and parties, theatre, opera, art museums and anything with a believable or at least semi-entertaining plot. My hobbies include The Fine/Performing Arts, Traveling and Photography. I come from an Artistic/Creative background as Language Arts/Creative Arts stimulates my mind and comforts my body and spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I'm a sweet lovely woman who is just looking to be with a lovely gentleman who I can spend time with and bring joy to his life. I desire to connect and explore with a true gentleman who is fun, inspiring and empowering. I am looking for a true Connoisseur who knows the finer side of life who wants to share memories and create new ones with an intelligent beauty who truly appreciates kindness. I would love to be spoiled lavishly.

        Confident, intelligent woman seeks same qualities in a man. I'm a very well maintained 54yo, younger man considered if he is mature for his age. I'm very sophisticated yet also very down-to-earth.  A lot of fun to talk to, sexy, and feminine.  We could meet first for a chemistry check, then take it from there.

        Hello,<br>
 I am looking for a liberal, well established man who is emotionally mature, fun and fit. Age does not matter as much as personality. I have traveled and find that for the most part, European men have values that I prefer. <br>
I probably won't be having children although there is a small window of time left for this. I am a country girl and a city girl. Well read, well traveled, and I like to make things. If there was one word to describe me- "Creative" would be the best fit. <br>
Some things I enjoy- swimming in warm water, fresh water, nature, cooking, making sculptures, leading projects, imagining up incredible stages for performance, growing a garden, international travel, theater, sailing, making beer and wine, laughing and spending time with my nieces and nephews when I can. <br>
If you are sincerely interested in meeting, respond with the country you are from in your title. <br>
Best regards,<br>
E<br>

        I'm tall (5'10), fit/proportionate (size 8-10), very feminine (long dark hair/ dark eyes), stylish, educated, sincere, funny, deep, warm, caring and affectionate.  I'm divorced and have no kids.   I'm extremely self aware and know what I'm looking for and am definitely not high maintenance, fake or overly materialistic.  I enjoy good food, great conversation, day trips (love the Bay Area for this), travel, outdoor exercise and watching sports.  I'm extremely relationship minded and am NOT into hookups, NSA, FWB etc.   I'm a huge dog lover and don't currently have one...so if you do, awesome :-)<br>
<br>
Please give me more than a one liner and include a pic.  Thanks!

        Hopefully if you've clicked this link at least one of the traits I mentioned resonated with you. I'm a fun, responsible, light-hearted and intelligent young woman. I've always been told I seem wiser than my years, so perhaps that's why I've always made great connections with men a handful of years above me. <br>
<br>
I'm passionate, about my career, about life, about love, friends and family. I'm very happy with where things in my life have landed, and try to maintain a confident yet humble demeanor that reminds me that while my hard work has paid off, there's also a bit of luck mixed in. I know there are a ton of great men out there, in all avenues, from bars, to grocery stores, to standing in line at the bank. . .even on CL, so you're not going to see some excuse in here about how I am "over the bar scene" or "not the type of person to get on CL" -- sure I am! I think I'm a pretty good catch, so if I don't mind grabbing the occasional drink or scrolling through the pages of Craigslist, I assume some wonderful men are browsing as well. <br>
<br>
As for what I'm looking for, I have always had a soft spot for tall men, as I'm a tall(er) woman myself, just over 5'8". I've always made really great connections with athletic men, but do note that I didn't say that means you necessarily have to have an athletic build. For me, a great connection doesn't come with a defined number of abs (I'm a curvy woman myself, with feminine curves and large, DDD breasts), but he does come with a love of the outdoors, adventures and taking part in so much of what our area has to offer. Local parks, art and wine festivals, nature walks, beaches, camping, tennis courts, bike trails, live sports. The list could go on and on. Ideally you'll come with your own list of adventure, and introduce me to the things and places you love. <br>
<br>
Education has always been important to me, and I'd love to connect with someone who shares this belief, and values the lessons learned and ways that a formalized education helped shaped the way you move about the world. In addition to all of the above, I find charm in men who browse their local bookstores, would rather play board games over bar games (though don't get me wrong, a night out on the town is great too), and think a weekend without plans is just as perfect as a jam-packed one, because they're full of spontaneity and imagination. <br>
<br>
The people in my life that make great activity partners, who I connect well with intellectually, who make me laugh and appreciate the strong sense-of-humor that I bring to the table, but who I share no romantic entanglements or physical attraction, make great platonic friends. But, since I'm posting this in the LTR section, I'm hoping to meet someone who values that a friendship will be what builds a strong foundation, but our mutual attraction and romantic connection is what creates the butterflies in your stomach, and the sore cheeks from smiling too much, and the kind words at the end of a hard day, and a sexual connection that's more satisfying as a regular and frequent element of a long term relationship.  <br>
<br>
I have always loved children, and while I absolutely have no issue with you having children of your own (even if they live with you full time), I am just not interested in having my own children. <br>
<br>
The other basics: I'm drug and disease free, a non-smoker, a responsible social drinker, don't live with my parents, drive my own vehicle, and wouldn't let distance stand in the way of a great connection, so if you're anywhere between SF and SJ, feel free to write! If any of the above piques your interest in a way that hints we might be a great match, please send along what grabbed your attention, as well as a picture or two. <br>

        This week has been awful and I just don't understand why we can not make this great friendship a lasting relationship. <br>
<br>
Seems to me we have been distracted the last few months, neglecting the very sweet connection we made. I am not ready to leave your side, not ready to see you go. My heart is broken and I just pray that your heart will open soon and you will find somewhere inside the love for me that I have grown to have for you. <br>
<br>
I am sorry to doubt you, to doubt myself. I have been having so many challenges this year, but falling in your arms makes me feel so much better. Please give it time and please come back to me baby. My arms are open wide for you...<br>

postingbody">
        1. I am really a female. <br>
2. I am really a female who isn't a cam girl or prostitute. <br>
3. I am tall and very busty (F cup) with a sexy thick curvy build and pale skin. If you don't like plus size / sturdy women don't respond. I know the difference between curvy-thick and fat-bbw and I definitely fall under the curvy-thick category. Because I am 6', I am only looking for someone who is at least 6' tall. <br>
4. I have a tight/delicate vagina (especially considering my stature) and love anal too much to be interested in anyone who has a monster cock in the double digits. Just being honest. <br>
5. I love being spanked, but am NOT into BDSM or D/s relationships. Not into getting tied up or humiliated verbally, so if that is your thing we probably aren't a good fit. <br>
6. I don't sleep around but am sick and tired of realizing every Sunday afternoon that I've spent too much time going on dates-that-go-nowhere and not enough time cuddling-laughing-fucking-flirting with a lover. Hopefully you feel the same. <br>
7. I have a really beautiful face and am drawn to men with really attractive faces. I don't care if you have an average, really muscular or thick (barrel chested) build --- a great face is more important. <br>
8. You must be STD free and drug free. <br>
9. You are SINGLE/UNATTACHED. <br>
10. You have your own place and have your shit together. (I do, too, for the record)<br>
11. You are looking for someone to take out on a date and then go home and fuck until we pass out. I am not into NSA encounters where the only interaction is sex. While I am looking for a lover and am not asking you to be my "boyfriend", I want a FWB situation where we do things first and just have an amazing time together. <br>
<br>
If you are at least 6' and at least 200 pounds and in the general vicinity of Pleasanton --- AND are addicted to busty thick playful women, send me a NICE message with a photo of your smile.

        Hello eligible men out there. I am eager to meet you!<br>
<br>
I am a beautiful blonde looking to find someone to share life's moments with. I'm single with no kids, never been married. I have a successful career and own a home. My life is good and I am happy. <br>
<br>
I'm in my 40's. I'm plus-sized. I have a quirky sense of humor and know how to laugh at myself. I'm an excellent listener and a good communicator. I cook. I love games and competition of all sorts. I do lots of things outdoors including golf, camping, hiking, swimming, walks with my dogs. Most recently I went inter-tubing down a river with my niece. Tons of fun!<br>
<br>
I'm goal-oriented and have a well-established career which makes me very happy. I've lived abroad and traveled a lot when I was younger. I'd love to do more traveling and see parts of the world that are completely new to me. I speak German fluently and am very much bi-cultural (German-American).<br>
<br>
That should give you a snapshot of who I am. I'm looking to meet interesting people with the hope of finding something lasting in the long run. I'd love to hear from you and see if there is a connection.<br>

        I'm going to keep this short, simple, and to the point. I'm in my late 20's and really enjoy boating and riding motorcycles. I grew up riding (as a passenger) on the <br>
<br>
back of my dad's motorcycle, since I can remember being able to hold on. I also had the pleasure of riding 1450 miles out to Sturgis last year on the back of my <br>
<br>
boyfriend's motorcycle (now ex-bf). I do have my motorcycle endorsement. Maybe one day I'll own a bike. I also really love boating. Just the same as growing up on <br>
<br>
motorcycles, I grew up boating also. My parents still have a boat to this day.<br>
<br>
About me....I'm skinny to average build, late 20's, height/weight proportionate, very bubbly, and cute. Not a drop dead gorgeous model, but not ugly by any means. Not <br>
<br>
looking for a hook-up. I would actually like to find a serious relationship.<br>
<br>
Hopefully hear from some decent people. So I know you're not a bot, please put what type of boat or motorcycle you have in

        Hi there.. I would love to know you.. please read my original ad so you can know more about me:<br>
Gentleman, Im a 25 yr old mother of 1, single black carribean female originally from the west indies, Haiti. I'm mostly raised and spent most my life in south florida. I am looking for a single gentleman between thirty and forty-five.<br>
<br>
I am attractive, average height a little plumper than average- though still considered a looker by my male friends. I am a mature, articulate, self confident and you should be the same. I am not interested in meeting men that lack manners, ambition and drive. I love a man who can be articulate with his speech as I am. I need a man who is straight forward. Say what you mean and do as you say-type of guy. I don't need a rich man. Just be rich with love, laughter, drive and a good heart with good intentions. I typically am more drawn to men from the islands mostly because I have not encountered any other guys who came at me correctly with the right approach.. I'm hoping that can change cause I want to broaden my horizon..cause dating men from my origin has gotten me to nowhere island! So I'm open to any race, but i would love an african man or haitian man.<br>
<br>
I just want a confident man who will treat me right and show me all the love and affection that I deserve and that i know that lucky man will receive from a woman like me. You should be at peace with yourself, and the world. I need a man who is thoughtful and very attentive, and who does little sweet things to put a smile on my face. Treat me like your african queen and you will get a phenomenal woman who will love you with no boundaries and be there for better or worse til the end of time... and Yes--I'm a hopeless romantic... I gotta slow down on the romance novels...lol..they leave me with too much great expectations.<br>
<br>
I would prefer to find someone whose faith-bound and believes in the lord. I consider myself to be christian though i'm really not a religious fanatic. I've sorta fallen out of loop with working too much and not spending too much time cultavating my faith, but it is a work in progress. I hate pretenders. Don't pretend you have this or you have that..cause Im only interested in whats in your 'head', your 'heart', your 'mindset' in life ~ not your wallet. I need a man who is dating with a purpose, to find the woman of his life to settle down with. Life is too short...I dont want to waste another minute of it.<br>
<br>
If I interest you send me a message please <br>

        The title says it all. I'm looking for a part time lover, someone I can enjoy spending a few hours with each week, enjoying a drink, some sexy time and each other. A mental connection is important. I've had two of these relationships in my life and enjoyed them both for years each. <br>
<br>
About me:<br>
<br>
Big woman. Maybe bbw/ssbbw /wtfbbq. 5'7". 35. White. Light brown hair shoulder length hair, blue eyes. I don't wear make up often but I do get pedicures. I have a hairy pussy. I'm laid back and straightforward. I'm fair with people and non judgmental, can be socially awkward, miss normal social cues and I can be funny. I live in jeans and motorcycle boots. I like Richard brautigan. I smoke weed. <br>
<br>
You:<br>
<br>
Between 30-50. Single and available to meet. Can host sometimes. Maybe foreign. Have a healthy attitude about women and sex. Understand the virtues of a regular partner (including the efficiency factor). Not flaky, not surrounded by crazy drama. Like butchy chicks. Not looking for an endless email or text exchange. <br>
<br>
Let's get a drink. <br>

        Loneliness is kind of like a rash I want to rub on you now in a week it will be gone or I will be crying in pain.  A relationship is like a rash.  I am a cynical person if you didn't catch on.  In a sense have something wrong with me I feel lonely and I know you will hurt me but I keep going back.  I'm single and expect nothing from you but to hurt me and have the affects linger on for years to come.  I am looking to see someone soon.  I know you're a weirdo that will get naked and shoot sperm everywhere I just ask you not to do it in my direction.  I know you will say who does that but every guy on here says they don't but then they do and blame you.  You will tell me it's my fault your dick is hard if you're cute I might entertain the idea for a second then over it when you want me to join you.  Then I become a bitch in your eyes and get mad or you might turn crazy violent.  I must have something wrong with me if I know what will happen and I say I want more.

        Loneliness is kind of like a rash I want to rub on you now in a week it will be gone or I will be crying in pain.  A relationship is like a rash.

        I'm Mary by name and a 28 years old woman who is never married and has no kids, seeking to meet someone matured and interesting for a long term relationship to greater possibilities.<br>
<br>
You:<br>
<br>
1. Intelligent, sweet, down-to-earth and adventurous. Bonus points if you're a little bit quirky.<br>
<br>
2. An ambitious go-getter. I'm attracted to people who set big goals and put all their effort into pursuing them. Even if your life's dream is to become the world's greatest thumb-wrestler, I totally dig it.<br>
<br>
3. A non-smoker... or at least trying to quit. As open-minded as I am, I have to draw the line at cigarettes. I can't stand their smell and don't want to be around smoke all the time.<br>
<br>
4. Pet-friendly. My dog loves to meet new people, but if you're allergic to dogs, the two of you probably won't get along.<br>
<br>
Me + You:<br>
<br>
An undeniably awesome couple with amazing chemistry. Let's make the world jealous!<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you're a laid-back intellectual who can appreciate a freshly made quinoa salad and the occasional chai latte, send me a message.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Older Man Wins It All Cuz I'm Tired Of Head Games (35 years and above)

        Hey there..I am a sweet, sophisticated and pretty Asian in my mid-twenties looking for the perfect gentleman who appreciates the finest things in life. Here's a little insight to my ideal weekend:<br>
After a long week, I'd like nothing more than to hit up the farmers markets-- if I'm feeling lazy Bi-Rite will do ;) -- grab a few inspiring ingredients and head over to our beautiful home. From there you'll pop a bottle of champagne while we savor the ripe fruits and cheese I've just picked up. Perhaps dinner preparations will be forgotten and groceries strewn as we get lost in our passions... But after a satisfying and leisurely few hours have been spent lavishing each others bodies, we'll be famished. At which point, I'll drape on the button-down you wore to work that day (because there is nothing better than my man's scent) and put together the meal I've been promising...<br>
Back to the task at hand-- here's a little more about me: I was raised internationally in a traditional household and knew by an early age that I didn't want to be your modern day working woman. My father was the epitome of masculinity and my mother was his queen. She doted on him whole-heartedly and their love was truly beautiful. This is not to say that I did not aspire to be my best self and achieve independent goals of my own. I am well-educated, extensively travelled and can be opinionated and out-spoken if the occasion called for it. I knew during my formative years that my general outlook on life wasn't the most popular among women of my generation, so I buried the softer elements of my personality and barreled into the corporate world. What I have found, is that though I am successful on my own merit, I am truly not my happiest. These days, my happiest times are when I play hooky from work and take my big, silly dog to Crissy field, where the wind whips at my hair and my clothes get sandy from the hours of fetch. But it always saddens me to drive back to my small, albeit well-appointed studio, because I feel stifled and miss the life I dream about. <br>
My ideal man is kind, successful and generous. He'll entertain my frivolous pursuits with a smile and anticipate my need for a movie-star kiss every once in a while. And he'll also know that though beautiful and sparkly things are not the sum a woman's happiness, they sure as hell help to keep a smile on my face. <br>
If you feel that this arrangement is something you've been yearning for, let's talk. <br>

        My battery is dying and I need to charge it right away so that my cpu doesn't cut out. Burning sweltering hot as my motherboard cools down.  My ram is starting to speed  as I start to fill up my hard-drive with space the more I listen to you.  My processor is going though so many changes at the time.  I found love with xp but I had so much pressure to move on.  I skipped vista because it just didn't seem like the right fit. I decided to commit to 7 but it didn't last to long. Currently in a committed relationship with 8 that's been going on a few months. I don't know if it's love yet but waiting to find out.  Sometimes I think I should go back to that old complicated love triangle I had with Linux but I just had to say bye.  I had a short fling with free bsd but it ended fast in the blink of an eye.  At the moment in a committed relationship with 8 but who will be next? I'm not sure at the moment they haven't been born yet.  Every now and then I have my daddy issues and turn to that old friend that started it all Dos. Sometimes I get in the mode and start to do some coding to checkup and see what's in his heart.

        Now that we are in our mid 50's and sixties, having accomplished most of what we set out to do. Our needs are very few but our desires and passions still run very deep.  We have seen our share of life's ups and downs and have emerged triumphant without bearing any resentment or bitterness.  We have a sense of self and confidence without being arrogant.  <br>
I am just wondering if someone like that exists with whom I can relate to as my best friend, my confidant, to trust and to cherish.  If so, let me know!  I am very well-educated and live in comfortable and peaceful surroundings.  I hope you are educated with a well-rounded and dynamic personality.  <br>
Do you exist? Just wondering!<br>

<br>
I am hoping to find someone who is low key, likes the simple things, and is single.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to post a ton on here - but I'd like to get to know someone for a bit and see where it takes us. What I am NOT looking for is a hookup or any drama.<br>
<br>
Me: Single - kid free - no drama<br>

Email me - tell me about yourself - send a pic and I will send one back.<br>

        I am a 48 y.o. SAF who is kind, educated, generous, and loves to have a good time. Love adventure, being out in nature, laughing, snuggling up to watch a movie. Like walking through the forest holding hands, admiring beautiful things with others who also easily find and appreciate beauty. More than anything though, I love my friends, my family and above all, they are my heart and soul.<br>
<br>
I am looking for someone who knows how to live, love and laugh. Someone who has a great sense of humor, who enjoys working out and taking care of his body, who can appreciate the little things, and who can see the glass half full, even when it is sometimes 75% empty. A positive attitude is extremely important. I am looking for someone who demonstrates respect, kindness, and gratitude not only to others, but to himself.  I'd like to meet a man who is confident enough to let me know if there is something that he needs or something that is bothering him. Physical beauty is a plus, but it is the inner beauty that will bring out the best in a person, and make me want to spend time with you. I'm all about passion, connection, and living, loving and laughing. If you are the person who will be best suited to join my adventures, then let's let this journey begin!<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading! If you feel that we might click, send me a note. And please share you age, physical info, location and ethnic background in your response if possible. A recent photo would be nice. :-)

        I'm a white 24 year old, 5'7 and 215lb lady. Although I consider myself a switch, I identify more with and favor the sub/slave/baby girl side more than anything. But im quite feisty, so watch out! Some of the men I've met have some kind of problem with my weight, which is a shame because I'm actually pretty friggin awesome and kinky. There's just more of me to squish & squeeze. I'm a total cinephile (especially zombie films) & enjoy making people laugh, dancing/singing to myself, learning new things, science, music (I'm a classic rock/punk kinda gal, but open to other genres), hiking, swimming, good literature (mostly true crime but everything from david sedaris & hunter s. thompson to henry david thoreau).<br>
<br>
I am looking for a deep, ongoing relationship with a tall, white man I can be with and submit to. A man I can cook for and take care of but also someone who gets off on blindfolding me and slapping my ass so hard it bruises. Someone who knows how and when to put me in my place, but also knows when to be kind and loving. I'm looking for a man who loves to talk dirty & be rough with me, while also respecting me in and out of the bedroom. Someone who knows that after I receive my punishment its time to cuddle & squeeze each other. I'm VERY affectionate. I've always wanted a big, dominant man I can serve, be with & take care of. I love pushing myself to new limits and exploring with others.<br>
<br>
I know that I'm kinda young and probably naive, but i feel like i have so much to offer this world and a lot of people my age don't have that same enthusiasm. Its hard for me to find people, let alone a man, that knows how to fuck me and to have intelligent and meaningful conversations with. Im so tired of the bar scene. Im ready to start my life & grow with my partner in crime... where ever he may be. I am very sensual and open to pretty much anything.<br>
<br>
I WILL NOT BE RESPONDING TO ONE-LINER EMAILS. IF YOU EXPECT ME TO RESPOND THEN YOU NEEDS TO GIVE ME SOME INFO ABOUT YOURSELF & PUT THE WORDS "BANANA MONKEY" IN THE SUBJECT LINE.

        So I just posted an ad to see what type of men are out there. So far I met a bunch of jerks, cheaters, liars, men who care only about themselves, and men who are obsessed with working. I can honestly say I'm not looking for someone perfect just someone perfect for me. Someone who likes me for my flaws and someone who is willing to take the effort and time to know the real me. If I could describe myself I would say I'm very blunt and I'm not afraid to put a guy in his place. I'm also very outgoing so to the point that I just came back from a strip club with my men coworkers. I love to go camping and hiking and no I'm not lying about it. I used to be a Girl Scout leader and lived in the woods. I also like to cook I've been cooking since I was young. My mother was pretty traditional in certain ways not about everything. I'm very motivated in life when I go through obstacles in life I get back up and try again. I learned that life is short and we should not look back in the past and think about the future. This may be the most honest ad you'll read because honestly I want you sense a little about my personality. If you're interested in talking with someone cool email me with a picture. If you don't have a picture I won't respond I literally will just delete.

        Thank you for actually reading this rather than deciding from my pictures. I've never been married and do not have children. I don't drink (I can't because of medicine I'm on), do drugs or smoke. I have a good job, car and live alone, with my dog. I like to travel, read, go to movies and shows and cook. I'm looking for someone honest, who can keep up his end of a conversation, is stable, single and who is open to a LTR. Extra points military, police fire and any other profession who save and protect lives. Please have pictures to share.

        I am looking for my warrior, the King of my life.  He has to be strong and smart and loving to the people he loves, but bold and fierce to the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
I am not Indian but love the food and cook all my own, home made, always.  <br>
Understanding your culture, I am hoping to find someone who is not obliged to marry within your culture.  I know this will be extremely difficult of a search, so I understand there will be few results in a shortly given time, but we are older and have the freedom now to make our own best decisions.  PLEASE, only respond if you are forty years old or older!<br>
<br>
If you are late forties to fifties, that is fine and nice.<br>
If you wear a turban, that is fine.  I love the long locks of hair, freshly released from this instrument which keeps it clean.  <br>
If you have children and are divorced, no problem.  I am the same.  <br>
If you take good care of your parents, no problem.  I have plenty of compassion to share.<br>
I'm looking for a man who is looking for a life partner.  Please be smart, perhaps educated, clean and nice, only drink small quantities at a time and absolutely no smoking or drugs.<br>
I am a nice woman, educated with a good career, nice place to live, am a great cook (not only Indian food but most anything but American) and am clean and healthy.<br>
I have medium length, dark hair, light - dark complexion and a great attitude and smile.  Life has led me to appreciate the nature in life, and I would love someone to share my life with.  Whenever I make my Indian Cuisine, I think what a waste it is I do not have a man around to share it.  <br>
<br>
I am very picky about the man I am willing to share my life along side, but not for the reasons most women are.  I appreciate very different things than most.<br>
Please send a good photo and your information.  I will respond in kind.<br>
I will not respond without a photo, but I am sincere when I say I am looking for a LTR with a great man from India.<br>
<br>
Thank You

        I'm looking to meet someone with the potential for a long term relationship. If you're attached or emotionally unavailable, please pass me up.<br>
<br>
I'm in my early 30's, caucasion, born and raised in sf, 5'6", hwp, and have blonde hair with hazel eyes. I'm financially and emotionally stable and appreciate the same in a potential partner. <br>
<br>
I'm not looking for a one night stand or hook up so if you're hoping to get laid on the first date, you'll be highly disappointed. I dont want to waste your time so please dont waste mine.<br>
<br>
Full disclosure: I'm a single mother, I dont drive, and my worst addictions are coffee and texting.<br>
<br>
In fear of sounding incredibly materialistic, I would like to exchange pictures prior to meeting (more of a tactic to avoid the embarrassing situation of asking every man at the meeting place if they are waiting for a blind date) so please have one available as will I.<br>
<br>

        Oh no! She already mentioned the L word! Click back. <br>
<br>
Hahaha. Not desperate for love, foos, but every time I hear that song, it makes me think about how much I love (and miss) lazy Sundays with a partner. <br>
<br>
I'm kid and drug-free (yes, 420 counts as a drug), speak three languages, enjoy traveling when I can afford it, will try any food twice, gamble more than I should, never have a clean room, always cheer for the Giants, and burp way too much for a girl. <br>
<br>
Be between the ages of 26 and 38. And no daddies please. I already have one... meaning the man who impregnated my mother, not a baby daddy. I am not looking for a FWB. Also, know the difference between they're, there, and their.

        Hello, I was just looking through CL, boy has it gotten raunchy. Ok, I am a very sweet, kind female seriously looking for some one great to spend time with and have fun with, plan vacations, vintage flea markets, artsy, creative, intelligent, talk world politics and for some reason I am finding sports interesting. I am height and weight appropriate, very out going personality, edgy, sophisticated and tom boyish.<br>
<br>
 I am looking for someone who is successful, mentally, spiritually, and physically. Someone that can envision themselves being in a wonderful loving long term relationship eventually. Negative energy doesn't work for me. In the box approach to life doesn't work for me. If you like to open doors, send flowers and no I am not talking about carnations lol. If you like surprises, entertaining both our friends, planning exotic vacations, and want some one to adore the ground you walk on...then you are for me.... I have a nice home,...my boys are grown but always welcome..I love an open door policy...I love to help people and will go out of my way...to do just that. I lived on a boat for the last two years...mine...not someone else's....I have lofty dreams and visions, intellect is on the top of my list!..I will put my pic up, one that was taken a month ago...If you respond, I need some semblance of content and a pic....Naked pictures make me laugh, not sure why guys do that, is that supposed to be a turn on, if you are younger, have your act totally together...chances are it won't work, I can date someone my sons age..lol...Look forward to hearing from you...and if you don't like my post that is ok, I am a straight shooter, a great catch and know what I want and don't..SMILES! Oh, one more thing, I put my picture up on this site to be forthright, if you want to contact me include a picture, I just can't respond otherwise. THX

        Hi there,<br>
Since this is CL, let me first say I'm not looking for anything weird or kinky.   I'm a normal gal who happens to be single at the moment and just looking for someone new to do stuff with around the bay area.  Could be movies, new restaurants, art events, festivals, a walk.  Ideally, we would click, and ride off into the sunset :op, but friends is okay too.  <br>
<br>
I think i get along best lately with SWM and close to my age.  I am asian myself.  I am told i look much younger so hoping you do too.  <br>
<br>
Please send a pic along with a bit about yourself for a reply.  Thanks.<br>

        I know this is an odd ad. hahaha and you're probably thinking..who goes to the gym at 2am!?<br>
<br>
I am trying to get back into the gym to start training my body for half dome and some real outdoor rock climbing. I have a long way to go since I AM 230 lbs. and I think it would be a little easier to rock climb if I weight a little less..? Haha...I don't plan to get skinny, that's not my goal. Anyways, having someone to go to the gym with will help long term.<br>
<br>
Why 2am? I start work at 5am most mornings and most days I work about 12-14 hr days. So by the time I get home, I am not likely to go to the gym. Even when I get off work early, I am sleepy because I wake up so early. I usually only sleep about four hours but when I do go to the gym I know that I need my full 8 hrs for my body to recover. So I think it will be a lot easier for me to work my shift, and sleep around 7 or 8pm, get up a little before two to go to the gym and then work. It will be very beneficial for work as well =) I've done this before and it was really great for work since I'm all pumped up by the time I get in. I would like to go back to that schedule.<br>
<br>
I'm not really looking for anything else beside that. I"m not doing it to lose weight and look a certain way. I am who I am and I dont need other peoples acknowledgement or approval to feel good about myself. My goal is to get to a physical state where I am able to do what I want to do. That is all...so I don't really want any eating advice...I love my food. I don't plan to give that up. =)<br>
<br>
"Life is too short to give up on things that matters to me (or makes me happy) for peoples opinion that doesn't"<br>
<br>
If someone else AROUND MY AGE 25-33yo that is looking for a gym buddy around that time, and goes to 24 fitness in east San Jose, Hit me up. =) Oh, Please be single as well. I dont want your lady or wifey to ponder why the hell you go to the gym with a girl at that time of the night. I dont need any drama. Picture is required since I will have to meet up with you. =)<br>
<br>
I dont really think I will find anyone on here, but I figure I dont have anything to lose if I tried. =)<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.

        I am seeking a boyfriend, NOT a one-night stand or hook-up. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My assets are not in my looks, although I am very presentable, well-groomed, stylish - - 5'7", blonde, green eyes. <br>
Moderately overweight..........a little over 200 lbs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I live in a comfortable home in Campbell, close to Fry's Electronics and Home Depot. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I would consider someone a little younger than I but OVER 50, provided you are sincerely seeking an ongoing relationship. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I can offer intelligence, humor, common sense, time, affection, good conversation. I like movies, some TV, small parties, <br>
<br>
cooking, travel and more. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I will reciprocate your response that includes a picture and the city where you live. <br>
If we feel an attraction (although you can't always tell from a picture), we can meet briefly somewhere <br>
<br>
close and take it from there. <br>
<br>
PS NO MARRIED MEN, smokers, heavy drinkers need respond.

        At this very second, I am geeking out over The Kinks on Youtube. From Bob Dylan to Metallica, I love rock music. I love a good vinyl collection and hanging out at Amoeba. Do you like Nord Electro keyboards and a nice acoustic or electric guitar? I have met a lot of people, but it's hard to find a rock music geek!<br>
<br>
Also, right now I am reading Kevin Starr and Jared Diamond. I am college-educated. I like to eat cheese and lobster. I love fine things, but I am also edgy. Are you into tech? Do you like the outdoors and hiking and camping? Do you travel to the farthest edges of the earth?<br>
<br>
Life is so boring that I find the strangest ways to keep it interesting. Are you into filmmaking or design? I dig modern art and dream of having a collection. What about real estate? Are you into fine real estate?<br>
<br>
I have met so many men and they come in all shapes in sizes, but I can't find one to keep me entertained. Maybe it's you this time...

        So it's been a VERY long day..drive home in traffic, walk in the door.. immediately you are greeted with the most yummiest of scents..the house is warm, cozy, clean and inviting...you are met in the hall with a smile, a kiss and cold beer (or a cocktail)... kissed hello thoroughly..led by the hand to the bedroom where your comfiest clothes are awaiting you along with a warm, relaxing shower...while I finish dinner...<br>
<br>
 Refreshed and relaxed you join me for what will always be a well thought out and perfectly executed evening meal.. (I am a amazing cook) ...adjorning to the livingroom with a home made dessert and great cup of coffee, we snuggle through what I am hoping will be our mutual love of silly sitcoms (in October I love the cheesy scary movies all the channels play ..the old HALLOWEEN AND FREDDY KRUEGER movies are my faves)...<br>
<br>
 After snuggles and mindless, no brainer entertainment we slip off to bed to sleep closely in each others arms or......... mmmmmmm I'll let your imagination finish that "or"..... but I am very loving, affectionate, warm and passionate when I care for someone...<br>
<br>
 Waking in a loved ones arms is indescribable... well I can describe it...HEAVEN... I make you a yummy breakfast, have packed you a healthy, tasty lunch complete with cute, loving post it's stuck to your Tupperware...lol... and hopefully I send you off with a smile and an anxious feeling to get back home to me quickly...<br>
<br>
 Corny as it sounds..I used to have that life....I used to provide that life to my ex.... and I want to do it again..I want a deserving man who is loving, sweet, kindhearted and funny , who still has adventure in his soul, wants to head out on the weekends... jump in the car and just GO...wherever...someone who has the freedom to do this... if your job is your life to the exclusion of others or you are looking for someone to hang with when it's convenient for you please pass my ad by...I'm done with "those guys"... by our age you can be settled, successful and know what you want without making everyone else 2nd to your job...please be done raising your kids...<br>
<br>
 I'll give you details about me if you find this to your liking and it is what you seek..a committed, permanent relationship....<br>
<br>
 But here are a few random things about me you might find amuzing...I am an 80's child right down to the music (not the clothes though, lol) I know every word to Rappers delight, both versions!!! Im not even 5 ft tall, I hate chick flicks, Im insanely sweet and have the world's softest skin!!!<br>
<br>
 Hope to here from you..please reply with your age in the subject line (be over 40 please) so I can weed out the wrong age ranges and I will also know you read the whole ad... lets be together before the holidays this year...want to spend them loving someone the right way!!!!

        Hi thanks for reading my ad.. Soo what i'm looking for. Well.... I'm looking for someone who knows what they want out of life. Has a job doesn't have to be the best job in the world but a job. And a car. Alright something about me. Well i'm a BBW... if you don't know what that is then I'm probably not your type. No worries. I like to laugh and have fun. I don't stress over the lil things. I have long curly brown hair, hazel eyes. I don't have any kids. I don't mind if you do. I'm not looking for a fwb, booty call, one night stands anything like that it's not my thing. So if that's what your looking for it's not here keep looking. I love sports..Can't wait till football starts! 49ers! Alright well if you want to know more hit me up.. Please send me a picture and your name so that way i know who i'm talking to and what you look like. I'll send you one in return. Hope you have a great day and find what your looking for!

Has a job doesn't have to be the best job in the world but a job. And a car. Alright something about me. Well i'm a BBW... if you don't know what that is then I'm probably not your type. No worries. I like to laugh and have fun. I don't stress over the lil things. I have long curly brown hair, hazel eyes. I don't have any kids. I don't mind if you do. I'm not looking for a fwb, booty call, one night stands anything like that it's not my thing. So if that's what your looking for it's not here keep looking. I love sports..Can't wait till football starts! 49ers! Alright well if you want to know more hit me up.. Please send me a picture and your name so that way i know who i'm talking to and what you look like. I'll send you one in return. Hope you have a great day and find what your looking for!

        This might be a weird post but I am looking for a person interested in modifying and molding a woman's body into the "ideal" shape. I have an intense (and slightly sexual) desire to be transformed into a human doll. Just short of bimbofication. <br>
<br>
I am looking for someone that would love to take this project on, someone who is a finisher. Someone who has the resource to take on a project such as this. Someone who is interested in body modification and improving on God's plan :).<br>
<br>
When I speak on modification I am referring to an entire image re-haul. Body modifications and improvement. altered presentation and wrapping (dying, bleaching, changing, ect). personality and speech patterns. . .also inflections and the like.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have been slowly working towards my doll goal, it simply takes time. I am looking for someone who wants to join my journey and assist us on our way (to greatness). <br>
<br>
I would like to build a relationship off of our mutual desire to create the perfect human doll. <br>
<br>
As for about me, I am funny, sweet, a hard worker, motivated and goal oriented. I adore art and theatre and dancing. I love to read, converse and learn.<br>
<br>
Anything more you'd like to know, feel free to ask (especially if you are interested in my project)!

        I'm a bit of a geek or a nerd. I'm quirky and an idealist. I love to talk but I can be shy too. I'm passionate about things, I use my hands to talk, I talk back to the tv. I'd love to pretend I'm all zen and peaceful but I'm anything but peaceful and I'm at peace with that (sort of). I get worked up, I have opinions, I'm liberal and progressive. I believe in fighting for justice, in protecting the weak and the vulnerable. I'm intellectual but not snobbish (can't be really), still working on growth but trying to accept myself as I am as well.<br>
<br>
Mostly I love good conversation and being surprised by new ideas. Some people are more into experiences but I'm more into things I can experience with friends. I've run a whole bunch of groups; film, culture, success teams, book clubs. I get more fun out of talking to people than I think I would jumping from a plane. The best times I've had were at all little venues, open mics, free comedy in coffee houses, eclectic documentaries. But none of it is fun for me without my people.<br>
<br>
The best guy for me is probably a bit quirky himself. Maybe an introvert, maybe not. He's smart, funny and kind but no pushover. I have a very strong personality so I need my match there. He has mutual desire for a serious relationship that does not involve other people (expect in a purely platonic fashion) that will involve lots of affection, talking, mutual fun, deep conversation, love and sex. Attraction is very important and its not all about bodies, its mostly about personality, intellect and drive but it's a little bit about bodies and so keeping in decent shape and within a reasonable weight/height ratio is a good thing.  This said I'm not usually attracted to heavy guys but other than that I'm not expecting perfection.<br>
<br>
On that note I am, just so we are all clear, pretty much what you see in the pics. They are all recent (several months ago) and I am 5'2, 100 lbs, good teeth, eyesight going to hell (damn!), curly (natural), red (unnatural) hair, no tats, no kids, just me.<br>
<br>
Age wise I'm looking for about 48 to 60. I come off younger than I am but that's probably because I was never a parent, never had a normal routine. I was always a contractor, worked crazy hours, stayed up too late, got up too late. I live with two roommates now, one my best bud, the other like a Felix to my Oscar. I do have a chronic pain condition so I can't do a lot of sports. However I can walk around and I'm going to get a dog so that walking around will be more fun.<br>
<br>
If this all sounds fun to you give me a shout. I'm an INFP if that helps though if you are into that then a NTP or NFJ would probably be the best, we don't want to be too much alike. :-)<br>
<br>
I had a pic of me playing a zombie in a friends movie but I got flagged so I left it out. It was just ketchup but someone must have freaked.  I'd be happy to show it to you later.  Please do have a picture of yourself.   Also no poly, no couples, no guys looking for 'just fun' and no critics.  Thanks!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

        I am a mature single woman seeking a compatible man who is close to me in both age and location. (I'm in my mid-60s and live on the mid-peninsula.)<br>
<br>
Like me, you are an intelligent, articulate soul who is actively seeking a deep and long lasting monogamous connection -- emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It helps if we are a match (or at least tolerant) on a number of other criteria. For example, I do not smoke tobacco, and I cannot abide being around those who do. I am omnivorous and enjoy alcohol in moderation. I am socially and politically progressive but tend to be fiscally conservative. Although I'm not wealthy, I am financially solvent, responsible and careful with money; I seek someone who is likewise.<br>
<br>
I was raised in an east coast Jewish home, and I'm still culturally Jewish. For many years, I have been an active Unitarian Universalist, a liberal/progressive denomination that embraces the inherent worth and dignity of everyone. Unless you're a conservative Christian evangelist, we should be able to find common ground.<br>
<br>
Shared interests are helpful too. Some of the activities I enjoy are cooking in and dining out, hiking and exploring, making and appreciating music, gardening and home maintenance, spending time alone together and with friends, and more. Although I like connecting with both dogs and cats, I currently share my home with a sweet canine who thinks cats are the enemy...so it's just the two of us right now.<br>
<br>
And, of course, there's the physical perspective to consider. I am 64" tall, weigh in the mid-130s (HWP), and am reasonably fit and quite healthy. I'd like to find someone whose body is compatible with mine. I'm told I'm pretty and attractive ... but attraction is so very personal.<br>
<br>
Beyond the list of wants and needs, ultimately the only thing that <i>really</i> matters is that certain something no words can describe -- the <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that attracts and binds, but is indeed hard to find.<br>
<br>
Interested? Then write to tell me about yourself (including your age and location), and attach a photo of your smiling face. Sincere replies from men who seem to be a possible match will receive in-kind responses.<br>

        i don't have it all together but here's what I do know<br>
 life is supposed to be about experiences; I'm missing out on sharing it with someone<br>
I'm very up front and sometimes flat out blunt. . .it's a confidence thing. I know who I am. <br>
<br>
That being said <br>
YOU: <br>
Confident not cocky<br>
Intelligent not arrogant <br>
Self made is impressive <br>
Enjoy keeping yourself healthy <br>
30yrs + <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm gonna tell you what holds me back from putting myself out there if you email me because<br>
I feel like it's a lie of omission if I don't <br>
I eat healthy and take care of myself. <br>
if you love the gym, runs or workouts and feel like you can't find someone who shares that same excitement ....that's how I feel<br>
<br>
I'm not perfect I'm a work in progress but I'm happy because I know who I am<br>
<br>
hope you see past my difficulties to find out who I am because really I'm not looking for you to fix it or complete me<br>
<br>
I'm looking to find someone who motivates me in other aspects because life is balance <br>
I wanna do the same. <br>
<br>
I don't date just to date <br>
I want to want someone not NEED someone<br>
 I was here doing me before you came. I'm not looking for a meal, a bed , a wallet ...whatever<br>
I want us to evolve into something, not force it. I don't want to just jump into bed so don't waste your time if you think you can change that. <br>
who I am<br>
straddling a fine line having one foot in being traditional and the other modern <br>
know what I want not afraid to communicate that's what adults do<br>
likes:<br>
yes I watch sports <br>
foodie<br>
love the gym <br>
happy to wander a farmer's market or street fair , blanket on the beach with a picnic or spending the day hiking <br>
love art galleries, wine tasting, theater or cultural activities <br>
just as comfortable in flip-flops, tank top and jeans as I am in dress and sexy heels<br>
love a good road trip <br>
sarcastic and love a good one liner<br>
no drugs <br>
l drink socially but can take it or leave it<br>
love life <br>
<br>
I can't get things together the way I want (and when I say that -I'm talking individually; for myself & by myself ) I'm not giving up<br>
I want someone not into games<br>

        First off, please if you are interested in sex, I'm not the girl for you.  I've only been in exclusive long term relationships and that's what I'm seeking again.<br>
<br>
Ok, ahhh, now that that's done.  I'm usually fun to be around, but, because I'm not working, it's draining all of my energy and stressing me out in looking for a job.<br>
<br>
What I'm looking for:<br>
An educated, fun, easygoing, patient, grounded, sensitive gentleman.  Is that possible on Craigslist, haha.  Must have integrity and respect for women, nonsmoker, definitely no drugs, social drinker is ok.  Professional, somewhat successful.  A strong, nurturing, supportive man.<br>
<br>
What I have to offer:<br>
Fun.  I'm easygoing, I'm easy to talk to.  I'm supportive, validating, encouraging, trustworthy. I'm loyal as well.  I'll have your back, haha.  I'm also very affectionate.  I'm a girly girl too but I only take a half hour to get ready :).  I love to laugh (but I don't expect you to sit there and crack jokes all day).<br>
<br>
Chemistry has to be right...not so much physical....it's way  more about the person inside.
